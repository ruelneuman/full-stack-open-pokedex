# Exercise 11.1

I chose to answer the questions regarding Python:

* For linting one of the most commonly used linters is Pylint. Other options include Flake8 and mypy. Some linters only fix stylistic issues, others fix logical issues, and some fix both. For testing there are a few options including pytest, Robot, or the built-in library called unittest. The choice of testing framework or library depends on the complexity and types of tests required. Some build tools that may be useful include fabric or buildout. Build tools will be dependent on the particular type of application that is being developed and in some cases they may not even be needed.

* There are many alternatives to Jenkins or GitHub Actions including GitLab, TeamCity, BuildMaster, Bitrise, Travis CI, CircleCI, Spinnaker, UrbanCode, Buddy, Bamboo, and BitBucket Pipelines.

* For a small team a cloud-based CI/CD environment would be preferable. Some advantages include ease of setup, container support, not having to worry about keeping plugins up to date, and not having to pay to run a CI/CD server even when it isn’t being used. However, a self-hosted environment could be preferable in some instances. This could be because of security concerns or very unusual CI/CD requirements that aren’t met by an existing cloud-based service.
